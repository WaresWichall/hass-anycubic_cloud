# Anycubic Cloud Home Assistant Integration

## WORK IN PROGRESS 

Component is working very well so far with a Kobra 3 Combo but will still have bugs that I'll need help ironing out.

Should work with multiple printers but untested until someone buys me a second printer :)

## UI

This integration couples with my [modded version of the threedy card for Home Assistant](https://github.com/WaresWichall/hass-threedy_anycubic_card)

It also comes with a WORK IN PROGRESS frontend panel which will be added to your sidebar.
The main use-case of this panel is as a file manager, but my plan is to add more functionality to it as well as rebuild the card in Lit instead of react. Any help there is welcome.
